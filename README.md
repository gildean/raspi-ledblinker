ledblinker
==========

Blink some leds and register interrupts from buttons on the raspi (or some other device with gpio pins).

![ledblinker in action](http://julkinen.salaliitto.com/misc/ledblinker.png "Ledblinker in action")

features
--------

You can set an arbitrary number of leds and buttons in the config, nothing is hardcoded to either the server or the frontend.

The changes made in the frontend are broadcast to all connected clients with websockets, so you'll see changes made on any client in real-time on other clients

usage
-----
__Make sure you know what you're doing or else you risk frying your board. Always use resistors to protect the pins.__

Set your configs in `config.json`, install modules with `npm install` and then run the app with `./ledblinker`

The leds are set as outputs and the buttons are set as inputs.

For the buttons you can set the interrupt edges (default: `both`) and the debounce timeouts (default: `200`) in the config.

Correct values for the edge are:

* `none`
* `both`
* `rising`
* `falling`

The value for the debouncer is set in milliseconds.
